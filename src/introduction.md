# Introduction

This is book is a labour of love and passion. Pyhon kickstarted my career into
the broader world of programming and has done so for many others. In the data world
it arguably enabled and empowered people to build solutions and make career transitions
in the same way that JavaScript did for the web.

Python is incredibly approachable, and easy to quickly develop sufficient profficency in,
to get productive. But this comes at a cost. It abstracts core programming concepts away
in a way that can be considered leaky. As a Python progammer I don't *have* to think about
memory. I don't have to think about ownership over memory objects, which part of a program
can read from a variable or write to it. But I *should*. Because if I don't I leave plenty
of foot guns in my way that are hard to debug when stepping on them.

Another issue I have with Python are its roots in Object Oriented Programming. Most people
feel that multiple inheritance wasn't the best of ideas. I dont' have the to authority to chime in on
that, but certainly feel the mental burden of trying to understand a code base that has more
than one level of inheritance.

Then there are types. After having discovered type hints in Python the world opened up in
front of me. I am lazy. I don't like writing documentation. Self-documenting code
was a revelation for me. Higher degree of correctness certainty through static type checking?
Count me in.

It may sound like I am a Python hater but I am not. Python is a very enjoyable language to use.
Fast prototyping, a great ecosystem, plenty of work opportunity. Some of my gripes just naturally
follow from the design tradeoffs it made. Others are baggage from a legacy that started in 1991.

I wrote this book with the strong belief that branching out into other languages generally
makes you a better programmer. And I think this is especially true when it comes to
applying learnings from Rust to Python. You will be more confident in your ability to structure
your code, and encapsulate in a way that makes it less likely for things to go wrong.
